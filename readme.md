# Safe Chicks

Chicks need to be safe so make door go brrrr.

## Ideas/Notes
 - Chord attacked to door and motor winds up/down to open/close door
 - Light sensor 
 - Limit switch -> use the iCab galenus switches? -> magnetic so will not weir out I guess
 - Solar powered?
 - Controller? What I have is:
    - Pico Pi
    - Arduino
    - Raspberry pi 3
    - Beaglebone black
    - Adafruit Huzzah -> has ESP.. 
 - Camera to see if checks are there -> would need raspberry for that (arduino is too lightweight)
 - DC motor
